# JDot Browser (JDB)

JDot Browser, or JDB for short, is a browser created by me. It’s not the full version and may contain many bugs, but they will be fixed soon. I plan to make it with WebGL in the future, it may look like a Windows XP browser, but don't be fooled, This is just a prototype, so don't get your hopes too high (just kidding).

## Important Notes:

1. **Multiple Tabs**:  
   Don’t try to open multiple tabs at once, as it may crash. I’m not sure if it will, but it should.

2. **Limited JavaScript and CSS Support**:  
   This browser doesn’t support modern JavaScript or CSS, so some buttons or styles might not work as expected.

3. **Games**:  
   Don’t try to play games in it. The browser is not optimized for that.

4. **Audio Issue**:  
   If you close a tab while watching a video on YouTube or any other site, the audio won’t stop playing even after the tab is closed.

5. **No JDK Required**:  
   There’s no need to install JDK. The browser will work without it.
