JDot Browser or JDB in short is a browser made by me not the full version this is may have many bugs in it but they will be fixed soon.
I will try make it with webGL to this may looks like a windows xp browser but it's not this is only a proto type so don't get your hopes high(jk).

important notes:

1) Don't try to open multiple tabs at once as it may crash idk if it will or not but it should.

2) this does not support modren javascript or css so some buttons or styles woun't work.

3) don't try to play games in it.

4) if you close a tab while watching a video on youtube or anyother place and close the tab the audio won't stop playing.
 
5) no need to install JDK it will work without it
